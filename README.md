## FAQ

### It's slooow!

I know, but I don't know how to make it faster. I'm open to suggestions. This is my first ever Kotlin project so I probably did something wrong.

### Getting `java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "node"`

Your IDE does not have `node` in its `PATH`. 
If you have node installed and it works elsewhere (e.g. in the terminal), 
the probable cause is that your "normal" `PATH` is not the same as the `PATH` used by IntelliJ.
That's usually caused by a custom `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`/`...` that adjust your `PATH` for your terminal, but not for IntelliJ IDEs.
**Hotfix** is to launch your IDE from the terminal, so that it inherits your `PATH` from the terminal.
```
open -a "WebStorm"` on macOS
`webstorm` on Linux
`webstorm.exe` on Windows
```

Proper fix would be to not use `node` from the plugin, but I simply don't know how to do that yet ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

## Issues/Todo

- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Intention to Suppress
- [ ] Intention to Fix

## Development

- Plugin should be able to "Auto-Reload", but does not work for me. I have to re-run "Run plugin" configuration every time I make a change.
- Debugging seems to work fine, at least for the "Run Plugin" configuration.
  - Does not work for me for "Run Tests" configuration.
