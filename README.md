#### Story-time explaining what this is and what it isn't.

I like markdownlint and Jetbrains IDEs.  
I wanted to to try out Kotlin and IntelliJ Platform Plugin Development ‚Äì had no experience with either.  
I had some spare time for it, but it's a fun experiment and should not be considered as serious polished project.  
**It's working, I'm using it myself, but it's far from perfect.**  
I'm open for contributions, advices, ideas, but I in all honesty, I probably will not be actively working on it.


## Installation

> **Important**
>
> To use this plugin, you need to have
> * `markdownlint-cli2` globally installed and available in your `PATH` (`npm i -g markdownlint-cli2`)

## FAQ

### It's slooow!

I know, but I don't know how to make it faster. I'm open to suggestions. This is my first ever Kotlin project so I probably did something wrong.

### Getting `java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "node"`

Your IDE does not have `node` in its `PATH`. 
If you have node installed and it works elsewhere (e.g. in the terminal), 
the probable cause is that your "normal" `PATH` is not the same as the `PATH` used by IntelliJ.
That's usually caused by a custom `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`/`...` that adjust your `PATH` for your terminal, but not for IntelliJ IDEs.
**Hotfix** is to launch your IDE from the terminal, so that it inherits your `PATH` from the terminal.
```
open -a "WebStorm"` on macOS
`webstorm` on Linux
`webstorm.exe` on Windows
```

Proper fix would be to not use `node` from the plugin, but I simply don't know how to do that yet ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

<details>
<summary>üí° Possible solution: Use "IDE's" node</summary>

Maybe rather than depending on system `node`, we could:

- specify `NodeJs` in `platformPlugins` in `gradle.properties` to require Node
- use `NodeJsInterpreter`
- StLint seems to work that way, maybe we can take inspiration from there

## Issues/Todo

- [x] Action to Fix file
- [ ] Restart action
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Intention to Suppress

## Development

- Plugin should be able to "Auto-Reload", but it does not work for me. I have to re-run "Run plugin" configuration every time I make a change.
- Debugging seems to work fine, at least for the "Run Plugin" configuration.
  - Does not work for me for "Run Tests" configuration. 
- Testing build by manually installing in IDE
- Run `buildPlugin` task in Gradle, not `build` task
  - zip will be in `./build/distributions` 
  - Don't forget to close IDE running from "Run plugin" configuration if you get "Execution failed for task ':buildSearchableOptions'" error
- How to debug jsCode blocks?
  - Not sure ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
